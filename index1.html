<h1>Sea Ice Extent and Area Data Visualization Code (1978-2019)</h1>

<p># First, we need to import our data from the "Environment" window by navigating the following steps:

    # Click "Import Dataset"
      # Click "From Text (readr)"
        # Then browse and find our dataset, "SeaIceMaster.csv"
    
    # The above steps eliminate the need to open our .csv data through code in the command window.
    
    # Next, we need to import these packages in order to execute the entirety of our analysis.
    library(tidyr)
    library(dplyr)
    library(lubridate)
    library(ggplot2)
    
    # Now, we want to run a few preemptive lines of code to organize our data for use in our plots.
    # We want to label our imported data set, "SeaIceMaster", as "df", so it is easier to work with during coding.
    df <- SeaIceMaster 
    
    # The following code creates an identity, "avg_area" which calculates the average area of sea ice.
    avg_area <- mean(df$area)
    
    # The code below takes the "year" and "month" columns from our data set and joins them into one date column.
    df$date <- with(df, sprintf("%d-%02d", year, mo))
    
    # Now, we want to make "month" a character value in the data frame using this code:
    mymonths <- c("Jan","Feb","Mar",
                  "Apr","May","Jun",
                  "Jul","Aug","Sep",
                  "Oct","Nov","Dec")
    df$month <- mymonths[ df$mo ]
    
    # Now, we can start to plot our figures!
    
    # Figure I. Dot plot for Sea Ice Extent vs. Year with dot size representing area
    ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = extent, size = area, color = year)) +
      geom_point()
    
    # The above code is sending instructions to ggplot to create a plot using data from "df" with the x axis values from "year", y axis values from "extent", the size of each dot to represent the magnitude from "area". and the color gradient of the dots to correlate to the "year".
    
    # Now we want to create an identity, "Fig1", which will print the plot upon execution.
    Fig1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = extent, size = area, color = year)) +
      geom_point()
    
    # Now, we can see that executing "Fig1" prints the plot of Figure 1.

      )
    
    # The above code is sending instructions to ggplot to create a plot using data from "df" to portray both "extent" and "area" (x axis) vs. "year" (y axis). Using the function "geom_smooth" smooth creates this graph of ice area over the years, showing the overall trends.
    
    # Now we want to create an identity, "Fig2", which will print the plot upon execution.
    Fig2 <- ggplot(df)+

    # First, we want to execute a line of a code which makes "year" a factor so they can be individual lines.
    df$year <- as.factor(df$year)
    
    # Now, we can create the plot itself. The code below is sending information to ggplot to create a line graph using data from "df" of "area" (x axis) vs. "months" (y axis), with each line representing a different year.

    # These plots are unique and fun ways to visual changes in Sea Ice extent and area over time. We hope you've enjoyed coding with us, and have learned a bit more about plotting in RStudio!
